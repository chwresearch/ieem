# Notes on Water and CGE

## Luckman et al (2014)

Since water rights in agriculture are mostly attached to land titles, such that land owners also own a certain quantity of water, water was either only indirectly included in the model equations as a fixed share of the value of land [e.g., Seung et al., 1997] or as a factor of production that is used in a fixed ratio together with land in irrigated agriculture [e.g., Berck et al., 1991; Seung et al., 1998]. These early studies treated the water sector as a passive rather than an active agent responsible for the provision of usable water. A very recent extension taking up this approach is to integrate such a CGE model, in which water consumption is included indirectly by linking it to gross domestic product (GDP), household income, and crop productivity, with a water- management model, which allows for a finer depiction of the water distribution within irrigated agriculture and within one season [Robinson and Gueneau, 2013].

An active water sector can be represented as an activity which builds dams and pumps groundwater to sup- ply irrigation water to the agricultural sector [Decaluw e et al., 1999], in contrast to an irrigated agricultural sector supplying itself by pumping untreated raw water. Such water related activities can also produce potable water that is delivered for use by other activities as an intermediate input commodity and for con- sumption by households [Go mez et al., 2004]. The integration of a water related activity transforming a raw water resource into a water commodity has subsequently been used in other models [e.g., Tirado et al., 2006; Juana et al., 2011; Watson and Davies, 2011], and it has become standard to treat the water sector as a productive activity that produces inputs.

Water-focused CGE models typically assume that water can be substituted, to a greater or lesser extent, by other inputs, usually in a nested CES production system. A range of different substitution possibilities have been explored: in arable farming water has been a substitute for fertilizer [Decaluw e et al., 1999]; pumped water has been a substitute for a capital-land aggregate [Go mez et al., 2004]; and farmers have been able to substitute water with capital to simulate a more efficient irrigation system, and thereby decrease water intensity, in response to the imposition of a tax on irrigation water [van Heerden et al., 2008]. Substitution possibilities between irrigated, irrigable and dry land have also been modeled: irrigable land can become irrigated land, using fixed amounts of water per unit area, or can be substituted with dry land or irrigable land without water [Dixon et al., 2010], alternatively the quantity of irrigation water applied can be varied (not fully irrigated land) [Calzadilla et al., 2011]. In models that include water consumption of nonagricultural sectors, water can often be substituted by capital [e.g., Go mez et al., 2004] or a capital and labor aggregate [e.g., Qin et al., 2012].


In many countries, water prices charged differ between consumers. This has produced a number of models that assess the impact of different pricing policies. Differences in (potable) water prices paid by different user groups, e.g., agriculture versus municipalities, can be captured by a water price distortion factor [Watson and Davies, 2011], or by applying different water tax rates to different sectors [Qin et al., 2012]. 

While most water-focused CGE models are applied at the country scale or even at the watershed level, some have used augmented data from Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP) to calibrate global models. Water can be introduced as a factor used for agricultural production or delivered by the service sector to the rest of the economy [e.g., Berrittella et al., 2007], and crop water demand is calculated based on evapo- transpirational needs, assuming no losses due to irrigation inefficiencies. Moreover, rainfed and irrigated agriculture can be differentiated [e.g., Calzadilla et al., 2011]. In these studies, the water factor is introduced with a value of zero, assuming that supply exceeds demand globally in the base situation; only after a water supply shock is introduced does water get a value. To date, these studies have not been extended to non- agricultural activities owing to a lack of data.

"Partial equilibrium analysis may be the best approach for analyzing economic impacts for small changes in water attributes (supply, quality, timing, flow, prices) that are unlikely to affect prices of other goods and services throughout the economy in an appreciable manner. Partial equilibrium approaches hold other prices and markets constant, while focusing on a specific water use. These methods include the hedonic property value method, stated and revealed preference, non-market valuation of the value of water to recreation and ecosystem services, **estimation of production functions or demand functions**, the residual method (subtracting all other input costs from total revenue), and linear programming **input-output models** where prices are fixed (Young 2005)" (Fadeli et al., 2012, p. 5-6)

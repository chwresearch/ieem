## Introduction



## Problematic

Rain cycles in Guatemala are strongly influenced by the convergence between the Inter Tropical Convergence Zone (ITZC) and El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). The former is a belt of low pressure, which circles the Earth near the equator where the trade winds of the Northern and Southern Hemispheres come together. The latter is an irregularly periodical variation in winds and sea surface temperatures over the tropical eastern Pacific Ocean, affecting much of the tropics and subtropics. The presence of the warming phase of ENSO (El Niño) delays the translation of ITZC to the North, limiting rainfall and increasing the average annual temperature. Conversely, in the cooling phase of ENSO (La Niña), trade winds between Northern and Southern Hemispheres become stronger, resulting in more precipitation and a reduction of temperature (Instituto de Agricultura, Recursos Naturales y Ambiente de la Universidad Rafael Landívar [IARNA-URL], 2011).

As global average temperature increases with climate variability, ENSO's warming phase is expected to happen with more frequency liberating heat pockets and delaying ITZC with more frequency. This translates into less average  precipitation and a predominance of dry years, punctuated by extreme rainfalls in rebound seasons. For Guatemala, this means that there will be an expansion of the dry and very dry life zones (IARNA-URL, 2011).

In an analysis of very-high, high, and medium water catchment and hydrological regulation areas, Gordillo (2010) found that only 39% percent of their territory had forest cover (see Table 1). The concern is greater in the case of the very-high water catchment and hydrological regulation category, where only  25% has forest cover.

In contrast, 29% of the three categories area is already used in agricultural activities (Gordillo, 2010) placing stress in the most vulnerable areas of the country, especially dry zones.

## Impacts

In a series of climate scenario simulations (see Table 2), it was established that in a business as usual situation where the global population continues to grow in a constant manner, with low technological advance and modest, unequal, heterogenous, and unsustainable economic growth, the Guatemalan dry zones are expected to grow 1.6 times by 2020 (from the base year 2000), to double by 2050, and to reach 2.9 times their area, almost triple, by 2080 (Rosito, Pérez, Maas, Gándara & Gálvez, 2013).

In a more optimistic scenario, where there is an international consensus on environmental protection, as well as more sustainable and equal economic development, the Guatemalan dry areas are still expected to expand to 1.3 times their size by 2020 from the base year 2000, 1.4 times by 2050 and 2.7 times by 2080. In some departments from the Guatemalan Dry Corridor like Chiquimula and Jutiapa, where food security is already a concern due to low precipitation and annual agricultural yields, dry lands are expected to grow from about half of the territory to over 90% of their area in both scenarios (Rosito et al., 2013).

Crops in dry and very dry life zones are highly vulnerable to the availability of rainwater and local food production is affected by the lack of irrigation infrastructure. Agricultural activity represented over 37% of total water use between 2007 and 2010, becoming one of the largest users in the country as an industry (IARNA-URL, 2013) for a total of 6,496.56 million m<sup>3</sup>. 

The combination of highly degraded water catchment areas, and a deficient regulatory framework results in water stress and high vulnerability. The Government of Guatemala (GoG) has identified seven Departments that are vulnerable to water scarcity and low precipitation: Chiquimula, Jalapa, Jutiapa, El Progreso, Baja Verapaz, Quiché, and Zacapa (Ministerio de Agricultura, Ganadería y Alimentación [MAGA], 2016).

## Possible Interventions

In the recently developed _Gran Plan Nacional de Riego_ (Great National Irrigation Plan), the GoG has established a goal of 100,000 additional hectares of irrigation coverage in five years, with an annual increase of 20,000 hectares, starting in 2017. They foresee that this will result in an additional 50,240 full time jobs per year. To accomplish this task, they plan on rehabilitating 13 of 29 abandoned water irrigation stations, with a budget of Q3 million (about $400 thousand). The objective of the plan is to reduce food insecurity in urban and rural populations, eradicate chronic malnutrition, while generating jobs (MAGA, 2016).
